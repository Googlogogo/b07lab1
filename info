This is the second lab of CSCB07. In this lab, I got used to the basic functionality of Java and how to use git/github. I modified the java files from 
lab 1, adding methods that can multiply two polynomials, read contents of a file and store them in two arrays, and also store information from the two
arrays back into the file.
